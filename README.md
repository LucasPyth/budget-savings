# Api Rest with Java and Spring BooT

This is an exercise in building a simple Api Rest with the goal of learning how to manipulate and persist data with a Postgres database.

It is possible through HTTPs requests to perform CRUD operations, such as Get, Post, Put and Delete.

This Api Rest is configured with Swagger, so it is possible to test each of the methods.

## Work columns:

“Id”: our unique record

“month”: column that represents the month in which the amount saved was recorded

“economy”: column where the amount saved is recorded
  
“image”: represents a photo of the reference month

# Versioning and creating the data table:

Furthermore, automatic creation of the database table and database version control through migrations with Fyway were configured on the server.
